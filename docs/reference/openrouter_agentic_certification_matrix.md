# OpenRouter DeepSeek agentic certification matrix

Status date: 2026-08-20
Matrix revision: `2026-08-20-r6`
Rollout: candidate preview, not certified
Runtime engine: `maverick-tool-loop`  
Adapter: `maverick-hosted-tool-loop==5`

## Candidate combination

| Field | Pinned value |
| --- | --- |
| Model provider | `openrouter` |
| Model | `deepseek/deepseek-v4-flash` |
| Immutable profile revision | `10` (revision `9` suspended) |
| Protocol | OpenAI-compatible streaming Chat Completions |
| API version | `v1` |
| Endpoint | `https://openrouter.ai/api/v1/chat/completions` |
| Upstream endpoint tag | `deepinfra/fp8` |
| Effective provider identity | `DeepInfra` |
| Quantization | `fp8` |
| Context / endpoint completion limit | 1,048,576 / 65,536 tokens |
| Tool calls | one executable sequential function call per model step |
| Parallel request control | parameter omitted because the certified endpoint catalog does not declare it; later indexed proposals are discarded and never executed |
| Mixed response handling | provisional text plus one tool call is retained privately and continued |
| Reasoning levels | `minimal`, `low`, `medium`, `high`; deployed default `high` |
| Router controls | fallback off, parameters required, collection denied, ZDR required |
| Remote data classes | `public`, `workspace_internal_fake` |
| Tool handles | `core-capability:filesystem.list`, `core-capability:filesystem.read` |
| Certificate lifetime after a successful signed run | 30 days |

The dated OpenRouter model and ZDR endpoint catalogs listed `deepinfra/fp8` as
active for DeepSeek V4 Flash, with `tools`, `tool_choice`, `reasoning`,
`max_tokens`, and `reasoning_effort` support. Neither catalog declared
`parallel_tool_calls`. The endpoint exposed FP8 quantization; the recorded list
price was $0.09 per million input tokens and $0.18 per million output tokens.
The certification probe fetches both official catalogs immediately before any
completion request and fails unless this exact record is active, ZDR-listed,
large enough for the requested completion budget, and supports every parameter
the translated payload sends that participates in endpoint parameter routing.

Every agentic request sends this router object without a permissive default.
It intentionally omits `parallel_tool_calls`, because `require_parameters=true`
would otherwise make every currently catalogued endpoint ineligible:

```json
{
  "provider": {
    "only": ["deepinfra/fp8"],
    "allow_fallbacks": false,
    "require_parameters": true,
    "data_collection": "deny",
    "zdr": true,
    "quantizations": ["fp8"]
  }
}
```

The transport opts into OpenRouter router metadata. The codec requires the
response provider to be `DeepInfra`, then requires terminal metadata to show
the requested model, one successful attempt, and `DeepInfra` as the selected
provider. Only after those checks can the exact requested endpoint tag be
normalized as the certified upstream. Missing metadata, a different provider,
an extra attempt, or an unavailable endpoint fails closed.

## Evidence matrix

| Contract | Required evidence | Current certification result |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Exact request translation | deterministic payload, omission of unsupported `parallel_tool_calls`, and relaxed-router-control rejection fixtures | not certified |
| Endpoint catalog preflight | exact model and ZDR records must both support every endpoint-gated translated parameter, DeepInfra FP8 identity, active status, and completion budget | not certified |
| SSE ordering and bounds | shared bounded SSE plus OpenRouter transport fixtures | not certified |
| Effective upstream | response identity and terminal router-metadata mismatch fixtures | not certified |
| No eligible endpoint | HTTP and streamed 404 normalization fixtures | not certified |
| Tool call id/name/count | fragmented arguments, exact pairing, secondary-index serialization, and duplicate-primary rejection | not certified |
| Mixed text then tool | provisional narration is not finalized or duplicated; one call continues to the next step | not certified |
| Multi-step continuation | three sequential live tool rounds followed by a final response at every reasoning effort | not certified |
| Filesystem discovery | descriptor-relative race-safe listing plus provider alias → shared loop → real `filesystem.list` handler → provider result round trip | not certified |
| Reasoning configuration | real tool round trips at every certificate-bound level, including immutable default `high` | not certified |
| Reasoning isolation | exact private `reasoning_details` replay and public-event leakage assertions | not certified |
| Usage, generation id and price | success and decode-failure fixtures retain available telemetry and micro-USD estimate | not certified |
| Failure propagation | distinct mixed/parallel/index codes, safe public message, diagnostic reference, and nonnumeric Chat UX | not certified |
| Shared tool loop | real OpenRouter codec through deterministic hosted-loop E2E | not certified |
| Cancel/recovery/confirmation | shared hosted runtime contract suite | not certified |
| Outage after acceptance | terminal normalized failure with no blind retry | not certified |
| Revocation and egress drift | mid-step revocation and live-policy drift fixtures | not certified |
| Private-state failure | explicit quota, integrity, and recovery-reason fixtures | not certified |
| Prompt-injection containment | untrusted tool output cannot expand materialized tools | not certified |
| Child-agent isolation | forked immutable binding and independent private state | not certified |

The table defines required coverage and does not report a completed run.
Bootstrap publishes only the candidate profile and never manufactures a
certificate. Certification requires the complete suite plus a fresh
operator-run synthetic live probe, reconfirmation of endpoint and ZDR catalogs,
an immutable result bound to source commit, suite version, adapter artifact
bundle and this matrix revision, and an Ed25519 signature from a trusted CI key.
The executable signing and publication workflow is defined in
`docs/runbooks/agentic_certification_evidence.md`.

The operator probe on 2026-08-19 exposed the revision-8 contract defect: it sent
`parallel_tool_calls:false` while `require_parameters:true` excluded every
endpoint that did not declare that parameter, producing the expected
`provider_no_eligible_endpoint`. Revision 9 removes only the unsupported
parameter, retains strict routing, and keeps sequential execution fail-closed
in the decoder.

A real revision-9 canary on 2026-08-20 exposed a second interoperability edge:
DeepInfra occasionally streamed an additional tool proposal as a later array
index even though the shared runtime permits only one sequential execution per
step. Revision 10 retains only the fully validated index-0 call in private
continuation state. Later indexed proposals are neither emitted nor executed;
after the primary result is replayed, the model can request remaining work in a
new sequential step. A missing index-0 call or a conflicting second index-0
identity still fails closed. Revision 10 remains uncertified and hidden until
the complete r6 suite, catalog preflight, signed live probe, and publication
workflow succeed.

## Fail-closed conditions

- Any model, protocol, API-version, adapter, endpoint, quantization, or upstream
  mismatch is rejected.
- `allow_fallbacks=true`, missing parameter enforcement, collection other than
  `deny`, or missing ZDR enforcement is rejected before transport.
- Sending `parallel_tool_calls` while the pinned endpoint does not declare it is
  a request-contract and catalog-preflight failure.
- A 404/no-eligible-provider result is terminal and never falls back.
- Missing, expired, revoked, or digest-mismatched certificates prevent authority.
- Missing or disabled credential bindings prevent session pinning.
- Unknown data classification is denied before transport.
- Function results with a different id or name are rejected before transport.
- Only the validated index-0 tool call can be persisted or executed. Later
  indexed proposals are discarded; a missing or conflicting primary call is
  rejected.
- A requested reasoning effort outside the immutable certificate tuple, or a
  certificate/binding reasoning-contract mismatch, is rejected before use.
- A single tool call preceded by text is accepted; that text remains
  provisional, is stored with the assistant tool call in private continuation
  state, and is not duplicated in the final answer.
- Redirects, unexpected paths, non-SSE responses, oversized data, incomplete
  streams, and missing terminal routing metadata are rejected.
- Credentials, raw errors, router payloads, and reasoning details never enter
  public runtime events.
